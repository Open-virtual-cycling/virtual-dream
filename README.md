An open virtual cycling platform

This is a dream but it could happen.

The primary open source platform would be the mechanics, software and computer resources of the virtual world:

    Virtual game mechanics, power, speed, position, ....
    Platform specific code for the game mechanics
    User accounts
    Payment system
    Network, compute platform to sync, store data, accounts


On top of the developers would be able to build, share or profit from:

    3d worlds.
    Different types of raced
    Events
    Mobile, pc, ... app
